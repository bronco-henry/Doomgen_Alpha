seldom seen he continued his search never showing his face unless threatened by bandits who prey on travelers who foolishly wander alone through their domain  doom are you awake yes but what do you want you fool it is a miracle that you did not kill costez as well as yourself so before you cause greater harm get out of here this is just a minor disappointment i shall overcome it the failure of dooms experiment did not end his tragedy for a few days later his bandages were removed there aah how horrible that face what have i done to myself my face ishideous he made me hurry my experiment now i must hide my face from all mankind but he will pay oh how he will pay so after his face was ruined he just seemed to disappear why did doom threaten just to well like i said he just disappeared i

word no a name mf the supervillain doomsday yea the whole mask thing really ight things in my point of view starting going to how things looked like opposed what things sound like ya know what i mean before you did not know what emcees looked like when you see em at party rocking you know so most times you em rock at a show before you even knew know what i am saying before videos pre videos you know so you were going off the sound of the record straight skills see once it started getting more publicized and you know once hip hop started getting money making thing then you start getting these corporate ideas where you want to put what it looks like to sell what to sounds what it looks like we dealing with music so what i did i came with the angle of it do not matter what i look like it do not matter what the artist look like it is more bout what the artist sound like mask really represents the whole rebel on trying sell a whole human being more of a sound at the same time it is something different you know what i am saying it fits with the theme of the theme of the rebel of a villain where to him he does not care bout the fame none of that shit that shit has no consequence you know what i mean it is more on the message on what is being said so it helps people focus more on what is being said it is still entertaining it is still like the theater it has the appeal of you know something it can be considered entertaining that message is still there that villain represents anybody anybody can where the mask can be the villain male or female any race so call race it is about where you coming from from your heart what is the message what you got to say you know what i mean that is why i mainly chose to bring the mask into the fold    fake song page created by a fake

boys wear them faggottylooking white shoes they look funny as hell ah looks like she got burnt laces bert you did not wash your neck sometimes we do not wash our necks but that is ok ernie oh i washed my neck taketake a look at my neck misc voice hold it right there you doom where you are going there are no jokes spiderman i am beginning to think that armor plated gargoyle does not like me gumbo you got to watch your gums on this but it is it is very good it is very healthy not perfect for every situation but edible wrappers could actually beef up your next meal you would only want to use the wraps when there is no food associated with the use of the wraps so uh some potential uses include um wrapping bulkpacked in a larger package and in that case the the wrap will actually form into a sauce when you cooked your your meats um there is also been interest in um development of using the wrap and then actually rip up the wrap and consume it that way the next day it is hoped edible wrappers will do a couple of things create a new demand for produce stop throwing out as much garbage as they do and eat more chitlins and that ended dooms plans for world destruction and how did you manage to stop him simple i rearranged the circuits once he threw the switch bang my ability to attack is faster than the cobra dialogue fades very helpful and i will be certain not to make the same mistakes as doom what is the hero who is the villain dead or livin killed or killin who the fuck should remain chillin doom webster says wicked and evil but yo who is webster nihilation and outcast equals freedom that is so fast culture in chains that be the rolls villain plays all these are just metaphors they describe symbols in folklore but who knows why it is like this hero hit or old miss maybe it is all good really of god but who should determine the real evil what is the deal fools rush in they do not know the yin from the yang and are ashamed to deviate or act sane from the norm they are slaves forced to conform to really find your essence take this as a lesson break away from the rest of them get from the form ending like the villain in the song find truth who determines wrong from right without a fistfight different from day than from night operation doomsday it is just a simple play on words delete all these punks ass herbs who is the hero what is the villain the question still remains chillin listen to the music try very hard to use it open up and research and that is the end of this verse but you all niggas keep you all minds open out there so like fuck you

flashbacks about going through the struggle how we used to make dollars from all the snow we shoveled in a broke neighborhood where the kids often dream about a lavish life that is mostly seen in the screen where some dreams are quickly cut short due to gang violence from loud guns that kept witnesses in deep silence was it bad timing jealousy from too much shining or a set up from a girl that he wined kept dining it is a known fact they will attack cause it is like that and depending on the kind of impact that strike back in a town where the talk is cheap and beef is brief a mother sobs uncontrollably and exhibit the grief large holes in the front door of a housing tenement allows room to retaliate so conflict is imminent this hate in the brain destroys the cells like cancer even experts are stuck with more questions than answers it is me and you son forever in the struggle no doubt we hustle survival is the motto will you soon follow a better tomorrow make the way for a better tomorrow it is me and you son forever in the struggle no doubt we hustle survival is the motto will you soon follow a better tomorrow make the way for a better tomorrow   looks like i hit the

savage nobody followed me do not worry i watched out what do you know about it you ran around good times girls you were special big cars and fancy suits this haberdashery why did not you stay home and mind your own business do not you see what you did you fool you bought him straight to me many would have you believe the golden age of hiphop occurred at the turn into the 1990s when the genre began solidifying itself setting the foundation for what worked and did not there is no denying the classical content protruding out of the era but in retrospect and as i will detail the praise many albums received came from the initial shock and legacy many albums carried rather than skill or level of quality it is this concept that leads me to believe that while the early to mid 90s could be considered the golden era one would be remiss for discounting our present day as the platinum the crowning jewel of our genre as a whole my belief that the hardened rules many lived by in the 90s only stagnated the progress of hiphop as a musical force in society relegating it to contrived topics of discussion that still linger in many mainstream forms of the genre today unfortunately thanks to the explosion of the internet however artists who would once never receive attention due to their odd work are now relishing in the love of fans with specified interests now let me start this off by addressing the clear obstacle and that is that this donede is nowhere near finished and a limitless amount of things could occur to alter my predictions this article is just that predictions it would be foolish of me to assert that this time is better than the original golden era based solely off the limited time had with the artists and albums soon to shape our landscape all i am attempting here is to lay down assumptions of where i feel this donede will be placed come the year 2020 and beyond hiphop has always been unique in that the genre itself has been moneeted around the concept of constant change where rock n roll country dance remain stationary in their own perceptions of the genre hiphop has always been one to relish in creative risks broadening of genre and accepting of outside influences hiphop itself at least from a production standpoint gave its origin to outside influences through the use of sampling something still used possibly to an even greater extent in todays age if there is one thing the golden era showed beautifully early on it was this dividing nature while the gangsta rap that suffocated the popularity early on with artists like nwa snoop dogg geto boys the bubbling presence of positivity lingering underneath proposed a strong division within the genre de la soul a tribe called quest pharcyde among others led the charge for a change in the near future for hiphop believing inspiring positive messages should be at the forefront with the gritty street life narratives residing as filler many outside critiqued the lack of structure for hiphop believing the unorganized nature of its layout to lead to its eventual downfall thankfully however organizing resided above in the form of mainstream appeal while unique characteristics or unusual topical content began surfacing in what would later be called the underground to this day in more forms than i would like to believe the same regurgitated topics have been strewn through every potential lyrical grinder since hiphops inception braggadocios rhymes bolstered with overthetop materialism and showings of wealth have lampooned the genre into a negative spotlight to those spectating from the outside as that genre with all the talk about money woman and violence any deeprooted hiphop head would point that ignorant soul to nearly any mf doom song the kingpin of the underground take kookies for example a song entirely created out of various metaphors for dooms night of masturbation now that is something you would not hear in any other genre or poss been afraid which details in depressing fashion the problems of a teenage girl growing up surrounded by abusive men what about killer mikes reagan a hypercritical showing of political dissonance through the use of a shattering bass and rising emotions hiphop despite what early critiques believed has thrived and succeeded solely based off this diversity in topic it is just a shame many fail to dig deep enough to see the crux that holds the genre up underground there was a time between our two golden eras where it did seem like hiphop as nas called it was dead the lack of originality in the mainstream devoid of any meaningful messages controlled by cheap dance tracks aimed at clubgoers had taken over the game onehit wonders dominated the radio artists like mims soulja boy and d4l as the genre once known for its hardnosed grit and grime had turned soft and poppy all for the sake of money gangsta rap was all but dead with 50 cent the game holding out last slivers of hope and peaceful samplebased tunes were converted into political activism in the form of antigovernment talk with artists such as aesop rock mr lif talib kweli thankfully as with any era of any form of entertainment is concerned purists of hiphop growing up enjoying the 90s only to be treated to the 00s began making pushes for quality taking it upon themselves to bring creativity back to the genre which previously thrived off it in comes 2010 while artists like blu and fashawn with their stellar debut albums below the heavens in 07 boy meets world 09 respectively showed promise for an underground gone awry thanks to dooms sudden departure their disappearance as well blus quality and fashawn entirely left the one gleaming hope of hiphops success without a light source kanye west had released 808s heartbreak nearly devoid of any rapping and entirely autotuned in 2008 only further cemented the death of everyone is once cherished genre with the leader at the time turning for other ventures that is until what many call hiphops savior kendrick lamone appeared out of the blue bringing realistic storytelling with impeccable rhyme schemes and lyrics to diverse beats spanning hiphops palate acted as the sole man beginning the mountainous climb to raps totem pole it was not just king kendrick bringing a new edge to rap around the same time dozens of rappers groups and artists began appearing bringing fresh flavors and unique approaches to a genre gone stale odd future with leaders tyler the creator earl sweatshirt surfaced with their odd combination of offensive lyrics and childish demeanors caonet the attention of hopeless teen lovers danny brown through years of work made his voice regardless of how scratchy and irritating heard over spastic beats like the zany character himself riff raff and lil b sprouted on the scene setting the stage for internet rap filled with hilarity and inspiring messages through simplicity shabazz palaces channeled dozens of influences forming black up a pivotal underground piece expanding the reaches for hiphop abstraction and finally death grips the band known for their bombastic ways of well everything down to the production unheard of in hiphop to this day mc rides aggressive stances scary topics of interest and unique flowing patterns breathed new light into the genre creating an entire subsection for his own these artists along with dozens others with their successful albums to back lead me to believe we are currently flourishing in hiphops true golden age the various styles now incorporated and more importantly accepted in our society today have successfully expanded the reaches of the genre into unforeseen territory new listeners are introduced every day to the genre through distinctly different means whether frank oceans stellar debut channel orange led some to delve into odd future or childish gambinofs scripted album because the internet sparked interest in those who tuned in to see him on community hiphop has become a global fascination thanks to this donede time will only tell where we see the genre go from here obsession has hit critical levels communities have developed and grown online over the years forums like subreddit hiphopheads are getting nearly weekly shout outs from important figures in hiphop society rza nas big boi jcole just to name a few while some may take the internet in todays age for granted no one can truly underestimate the impact it has on our culture today there are now interests and hobbies for everyone some so strange and elusive that even uttering it in real life prior would have one shunned from society hiphop more than any other genre has succeeded the greatest from the internet with mixtapes and no name rappers now able to get their shot at fame through appreciative masses lil b can now release a 101 song mixtape for his devoted followers while kanye west can drop a song a week for good fridays death grips is allowed to release a highlyexperimental electronic album for free on their website on the day of its announcement to appease their legion of followers and one rapper/producer from brooklyn can come together with another emcee from atlanta to form a power duo titled run the jewels bringing underground intangibles to mainstream appeal we have come a long way from the natural divide between gangster and peace wutang clan and de la soul streetwise stomp anthems and heartfelt sampled simplicities you know there is many teenagers nowadays growing up in the 2000s era hiphop who are now treated to the expanse of sounds we now experience today and upon their first visit to the socalled golden era many may leave disappointed in the lack of originality distinction and uniqueness the one exception to this as was destined to be the case is outkast dominating the 90s as their title implies outcasts and as time continues to progress it very well seems like they may be the ones forever lasting consistently ahead of their time breaking ground where ground became rigid the state of 90s hiphop one continuously lamented in praise was all but and shown ever so succinctly during the 1995 source awards when receiving their reward for best new group to the thundering rousing of booes from the new york crowd outkast was thrown out and rejected by the elitism between the two dominate coasts unable to include another voice in the matter despite andre 3000s determined shout that the south got something to say that is all i got to say raps golden era was one so focused on two battles the battle of the coasts both with their own versions of gritty street tellings and the battle of that genre and the daisy movement acting as the antithesis hiphop now is so diverse that both of those are represented freddie gibbs shad and hundreds more from funny riff raff to political killer mike to experimental sisyphus to party schoolboy q 2 chainz to brash death grips to lyrical kendrick lamone to somber drake to individuality where not fitting into any predetermined stereotype of hiphop exists tyler the creator never before has hiphop been so blessed with a vast array of sounds styles and situations leaving little room for those who remain adamant in refusing to accept the genre for its talents there is little confusion now that hiphop is dead it is alive and thriving and i would go so far as to say it is at the peak of its career one who all of us hope lasts forever hello i am dean stockton of eastern state university in america and i am prepared to offer you a full science scholarship viktor used the college used its modern scientific
