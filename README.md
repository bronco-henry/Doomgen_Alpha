# Doomgen_Alpha
Attempting to create and train a recurrent neural net on the lyrics of MF Doom may he rest in peace.

TODO:

- add checkpoints so I don't have to re-train
- add interactive mode so I can call 'predict' (found in train.py) again and again easily
- split data into test, train, valid at 10%, 80%, 10%

DONE: - fix devices so GPU/CUDA is used instead of CPU
