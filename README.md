# Doomgen_Alpha
Attempting to create and train a recurrent neural net on the lyrics of MF Doom may he rest in peace.

TODO:

- split data into test, train, & valid sets
- experiment with re-formatting data (i.e. newlines where lines actually end)
- experiment with different configuration of types and numbers of layers
- try out the model with different datasets i.e. twitch chat logs

DONE:

- fix devices so GPU/CUDA is used instead of CPU
- add checkpoints so I don't have to re-train
